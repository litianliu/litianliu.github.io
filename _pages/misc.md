I am a native Mandarin speaker and understand Cantonese well as part of my college heritage. I am also an elementary learner of Japanese and Korean. 

I am broadly interested in philosophy and pursued a minor in philosophy during my Doctor of Philosophy degree. Here are my writing samples:
- [Art, Science and Good Life in Schopenhauerian System](/assets/pdf/Schopenhauer.pdf)
- [Zhuangzi on Death](/assets/pdf/Zhuangzi.pdf)

Additionally, I play the piano. I'm fortunate to learn from the inspiring musician [Aimee Tsuchiya](https://necmusic.edu/faculty/aimee-tsuchiya) at New England Conservatory.
